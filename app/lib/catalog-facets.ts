 *   An entry can carry several categories, and "Umwelt or Mobilität" is the
 *   question people actually ask. The default.
 * - `ordinal` — an ordered scale where choosing a value means "at most this".
 *   Cost and effort bands: the label already says „unter 10.000 €", so an
 *   entry costing under 1.000 € has to match it. Exact equality here made the
 *   filter contradict its own label (found 2026-09-23).
 * - `toggle` — a yes/no property. One option, on or off.
